PHASE 1 Usability & Visual polish

Modern, responsive layout: split screen—road on the left, control/metrics panel on the right.
Live metrics: generation, best distance, FPS.
Runtime sliders + buttons • # cars • mutation rate • sensor count / length
All update the simulation instantly—no code edits needed.
Improved car/traffic sprites with CSS hue-rotation for variety.
Dark-mode friendly color palette.

PHASE 2 Better AI / training feedback

Training stats chart (tiny canvas) plotting best distance per generation.
“Ghost replay” of the previous best car so you can visually compare progress.
Two training modes
• Classic genetic (current)
• Hill-climb (mutate one survivor continuously) — toggled from UI.

PHASE 3 Performance & code quality

Web Worker to run physics + NN update loop off-thread; main thread just draws.
Modular ES modules (import) instead of many <script> tags.
Config file (config.js) instead of hard-coded numbers.
Small refactors (constants, utility functions, arrow functions, stricter typing via JSDoc).
Optional: Stats.js or simple rolling-average FPS counter.
Deliverables • New files: ui.js, chart.js, config.js, worker.js, updated 
index.html
, minor edits across existing JS.
• README section on new features.

Estimated impact • Far smoother on low-end hardware (worker + throttled FPS).
• Much clearer feedback—users actually see the AI improving.
• Tweak-and-play feel; shareable demos (just open HTML).
